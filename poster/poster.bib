	abstract = {The effective delayed neutron fraction is an important reactor kinetics parameter. In flowing liquid-fuel reactors, this differs from the delayed neutron fraction because of the emission of delayed neutrons with a lower energy spectrum than prompt and the delayed neutron precursor (DNP) drift due to the fuel movement. In general, neglecting delayed neutron precursor drift leads to an over-estimation of the effective delayed neutron fraction. Nevertheless, the capability to simulate this peculiar phenomenon is not available in most reactor physics tools. In this project, a multi-physics approach to modeling DNP drift is developed using the GeN-Foam toolkit, and it benchmarked against available experimental data from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). GeN-Foam couples a neutron diffusion solver with a thermal-hydraulics solver. Additionally, a new function was added for solving adjoint multi-group diffusion eigenvalue problems and calculating effective delayed neutron fraction. For benchmarking, an R-Z model of the MSRE was developed in GeN-Foam. The porous media model was applied, and cross sections were generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent-1 with ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library. In order to evaluate the impact of DNP drift, two steady-state conditions (stationary and flowing salt at 1200 gpm) were simulated. A reactivity change of -241 pcm was calculated using GeN-Foam for the MSRE between static and flowing fuel, which is in a good agreement with the experimental value of -212 pcm. The total effective delayed neutron fraction change was calculated to be -230 pcm vs. -304 pcm reported for the MSRE and analytical calculated during the experimental campaign. Three transient accidents were also analyzed.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts has enhanced interest in building the tools necessary to analyze these systems. A Python script known as ChemTriton has been developed to simulate equilibrium MSR fuel cycle performance by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt using SCALE for neutron transport and depletion calculations. Improved capabilities in ChemTriton include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based MSR fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these MSRs to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on MSR operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-MSR system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

	abstract = {Interest in circulating fuel reactors (CFRs), particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs) of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting with a resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of CFRs, which is a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work first reviews the physical phenomena unique to CFRs in light of current research and how CFR kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general, it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) through the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible. An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating CFR kinetics is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux systems using representative codes from each of the main modeling categories. Comparisons among methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or nonuse in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general, it is recommended that time-resolved, multigroup neutron diffusion approaches be used to establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics (PRK)–based approaches that themselves may not be applicable for all modeling situations. In such cases, it is suggested that quasi-static approaches be used where PRK-based approaches cannot be used. Finally, a review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting turbulent diffusion in open core–type CFRs is a poor assumption that leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the delayed neutron fraction. Additionally, it is seen that exclusion of secondary heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and troughs.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-ﬁdelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a fullcore, high-ﬁdelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and veriﬁes these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-ﬁdelity analyses.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, use of thorium in fast reactors has been gaining increasing attention due to its favorable features in terms of waste minimization and resource availability. In particular, use of thorium in a closed cycle leads to a limited build-up of transuranic isotopes, and to a lower radio-toxicity generation. Unfortunately, U233 breeding is always accompanied by the production of undesirable U232, which represents a serious radiological hazard to workers during fuel reprocessing and, in particular, fabrication. A possible way to partially overcome such difficulty would be to avoid fuel pin fabrication through the development of liquid-fuelled reactors, among which the most promising ones are the Molten Salt Reactors. The present paper investigates the fuel cycle performances of the reference GEN-IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) in terms of isotope evolution, radio-toxicity generation and safety parameters, considering different fuel cycle strategies. Main results are also compared with those obtained for the GEN-IV ELSY Lead Fast Reactor. Calculations are performed by means of the EQL3D procedure developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Switzerland) for the analysis of equilibrium fuel cycles in fast reactors. In order to take into account the peculiarities of the MSFR design, a modified version of the procedure is proposed and adopted to model on-line reprocessing and the presence of blankets.},

	abstract = {A neutronic parametric study is performed for graphite-moderated molten-salt (MS) critical or source-driven sub-critical transmuting reactors. The NaF-ZrF 4 MS reactor is fuelled with transuranium isotopes from LWR spent fuel and operates in a once-through mode. The MS with actinides is continuously fed and continuously extracted at a very slow rate. All the fission products are removed from the core as soon as formed. The primary question addressed is whether or not it is possible to design such a reactor to have an acceptable k eff when at equilibrium composition, while the Ac concentration is below their solubility limit, and what is the corresponding transmutation fraction. The primary design variables are the MS channel diameter and the graphite-to-MS volume ratio (C/MS). For an average power density of 390 W/cm 3 of MS, MS feed rate of 1 millilitre/day/MW th and actinide concentration of 12.87 mol\% it was found that both k eff and the fractional transmutation peak while the equilibrium concentration is at a minimum when C/MS is close to 1.0. The equilibrium actinide concentration is below the solubility limit for C/MS between 1 and 7 for 7cm and 3.5 cm channel diameter and between 1 and 15 for a 1 cm channel diameter. The peak k eff is close to 1.0 and the fractional transmutation exceeds 90\% in one pass through the core. The Pu coming out from the C/MS=12 core has a very low fissile content of only 17\%. The optimal core has an epithermal spectrum and small channel diameter. The graphite lifetime in the core is 0.6 or 1.3 years for C/MS of 1 or 3, respectively. Reduction of the power density to 39 W/cm 3 can increase the graphite lifetime by an order of magnitude. This reduction of the power density reduces the attainable k eff by {\textasciitilde}5\% and increases the equilibrium actinide concentration by {\textasciitilde}0.4 mol\%.

The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the MSBR project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo MCNP code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a MSBR-1ike refeience system with 232Th/233Ufuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with the plutonium from PWR spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232Th/233U MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233Uproduction in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with 233U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with {\textasciitilde}3UTh/233U fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation.},

MOSART is one of conceptual designs in the molten salt reactor (MSR) category of the Generation-IV systems. This type of reactors is distinguished by the use of liquid fuel circulating in and out of the core, which offers many unique advantages but complicates the modeling and simulation of core behavior using conventional reactor physics codes. The TRITON control module in SCALE6 can perform reliable depletion and decay analysis for many reactor physics applications due to its problem-dependent cross-section processing and rigorous treatment of neutron transport. In order to accommodate a simulation of on-line refueling and reprocessing scenarios, several in-house programs together with a run script were developed to integrate a series of stepwise TRITON calculations; the result greatly facilitates the neutronics analyses of long-term MSR operation. Using this method, a detailed reexamination of the MOSART operation in 30 years was performed to investigate the neutronic characteristics of the core design, the change of fuel salt composition from start-up to equilibrium, the effects of various salt reprocessing scenarios, the performance of actinide transmutation, and the radiotoxicity reduction.},

This article builds upon the existing research into MSRs to model and simulate the operation of thorium-fueled single-ﬂuid and two-ﬂuid reactors. The analysis is based on neutronics calculations and focuses on denatured MSR systems. Resource utilization and basic proliferation-risk attributes are compared to those of standard light-water reactors. Depending on speciﬁc design choices, even fully denatured reactors could reduce uranium and enrichment requirements by a factor of 3–4. Overall, denatured single-ﬂuid designs appear as the most promising candidate technology minimizing both design complexity and overall proliferation risks despite being somewhat less attractive from the perspective of resource utilization.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},
